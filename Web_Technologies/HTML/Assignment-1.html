    <h1>ðŸŒŸ<u>Stars</u></h1>
    
    <p><b><i>Stars</i></b> are massive, glowing spheres of hot gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, held together by their own gravity. They emit light and heat due to nuclear fusion happening in their cores.    
    </p>
    
    <h3>ðŸ”¥ How Do Stars Shine?</h3>
    
    <p>Stars shine by <i>fusing hydrogen atoms into helium </i>in their core, releasing a huge amount of energy.<br> This process is called <b>nuclear fusion.</b></p>
    <pre>
       * Fusion = Light + Heat

       * This energy moves outward from the core and eventually escapes into space as radiation (light and other forms of energy).

        <h3>ðŸŒž Fun Facts</h3> 
            <pre>  
                The Sun is a medium-sized G-type main sequence star.

                Stars don't twinkle â€” it's the Earth<sup>,</sup>s atmosphere that causes the twinkling effect.

                A light-year is the distance light travels in one year â€” about 9.46 trillion km. That's how far many stars are from us.
